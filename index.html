    <h2>My Week :3</h2>
    <h3>Name : Afif________________________________Age : 12</h3>
    <h3>Howdy, My name is Afif, I am a student at the Baptist school. My week is very busy. Every morning I get up at 7:00 AM, Have breakfast so my dad could drive me to school. I study English, Math, History, Science, Chemistry,Arabic, Sport and Technology. My favorite day is Friday. Because Friday is the last day of school. After school I usually do my homework at my grandmas place. Then I go to an after-school activity. I play karate, I have it in every single but I usually go on Tuesday, Wednsday and friday. I also have a violin lesson on thursday. That's my week. It's busy, but I like it!</h3>
